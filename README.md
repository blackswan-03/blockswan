# blockswan
- A rudimentary blockchain built with JavaScript.
- This is NOT meant to be a real blockchain; it's just for educational purposes.
- This code was taken from a tutorial series by Savjee A.K.A. SimplyExplained (URL: https://github.com/Savjee/SavjeeCoin)
- However, it was manually typed, with no cut-and-paste, and all comments are mine.
- Big thanks to Savjee for this project😉
